A new component instance gets created with every new request.
To keep the instance just bind the component to a ManagedBean (to be more precise: take an YFrame).
There's a slightly difference between bindings of plain UIComponents and YComponents.</br>
A binding for a plain JSF UIComponent directly pushes/pulls the UIComponent instance into or from the ManagedBean.
However, a binding for a YComponent uses a special binding class named YComponentBinding. 
(Why is explained later) 
To enable some YFaces specific lifecycle features it's recommended that your ManagedBeans who are dealing with
YComponentBindings are instances of YFrame.

The example component just increases a counter and displays the hash code. 
It can be seen that the bound component keeps the instance whereas the other one always gets recreated.

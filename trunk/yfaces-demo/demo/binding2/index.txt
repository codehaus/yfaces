YFaces extends general JSF binding technique with the possibility to have a small meta-class or a "binding wrapper".
This allows a more particulary description of the binding type and gives the programmer more control.
The view looks exactly the same except that the ManagedBean returns a YComponentBinding instance instead
of the component instance itself.

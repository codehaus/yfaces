Chapter I - Define and use a component

{usecase}
Pass property values to component from view (push/inject values)

{parts}

{long}
This chapter just demonstrates the easiest way of using a component.
The component class basically defines available component properties. 
The component view just displays them.
The component is made available as Tag named after the components view file.
Available Tag Attributes are depending on your component properties.
<br/>
Steps to build your component: Create a component class, create a component view (don't forget to declare
your component class there and optionally the properties which are allowed to set from within the view),
put your view file into <code>/components</code> folder of your webapp. Thats all.

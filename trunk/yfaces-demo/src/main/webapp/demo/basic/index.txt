Define and use a component

{usecase}
Just a basic component consisting of a class and a view

_$cmpView_
The view must be enclosed within _yf:component_ Tag and needs at least an _impl_ value for the component class.
An optional attribute _injectable_ lists component properties which shall support value passing from view side to component class.
For component properties which are not listed setter injection is disabled.

_$cmpImpl_
Simple class which just manages some properties and extends _AbstractYComponent_. Except _name_ all properties are empty by default.

_$frameView_
The page view which uses the component as demonstrated below.


{example-ex1}
<chp:demo/>
Displays the component with it's default state and behavior. Property _name_ has a default value.

{example-ex2}
<chp:demo code="FRUIT-1"/>
Displays the component but passes value of attribute _code_ to component setter _setCode(String)_ first.

{example-ex3}
<chp:demo name="citron fruit" imageUrl="/images/CEF_1112.jpg"/>
Displays the component but passes values of attributes _name_ and _imageUrl_ to an appropriate component setter first.
The default component value for _name_ gets overwritten.

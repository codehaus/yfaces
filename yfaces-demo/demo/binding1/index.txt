A new component instance will be created with every new request.
To keep the instance just use the 'binding' Attribute.
This is a JSF standard mechanism and allows binding your instance to a ManagedBean.
The component instance now has the scope of your ManagedBean.<br/>
<br/>
For those who are already familiar with a JSF binding this chapter should give nothing new.<br/>
For all others: This chapter uses a ManagedBean with session scope and binds the second component instance
to it. This causes JSF to fetch the component instance from that bean with every request.
In case no instance is available an initial one gets created and injected into the ManagedBean.<br/>
Hash code of example one (unbound component) always changes whereas hash code of example two (bound component)
is always the same which proves that the instance is always the same.

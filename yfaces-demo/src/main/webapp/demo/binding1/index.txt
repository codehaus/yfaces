Component binding

{usecase}
YComponent lifetime behavor equals that one of plain JSF UIComponents.
<b>(EXCEPTION and TODO: JSF components are same after doing a post onto same view without the need of a binding)</b>
As known from JSF just use _binding_ to bind your component instance to a ManagedBean or others.


{example-ex1}
<chp:demo/>
YComponent is always newly created.

{example-ex2}
<chp:demo binding="#{demoBean.component}"/>
YComponent is always same instance.
demoBean is ManagedBean whose scope is session.
